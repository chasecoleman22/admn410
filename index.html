		<h4>History</h4> 
<p>Durham House of Pets was established in 2003 by Ann Spaulding.Originally,
 Durham House of Pets was created to help the growing popoulation of stray animals around the
 Durham, New Hamshire area. Duraham House of Pets became known as "DHOP," and the place to go 
for adopting and putting up for adoption. Slowly over the years, Ann started carrying more and more products
to cater to the majority of the pets coming through her store. Now in the present, DHOP has a large array 
of food choices, supplies, and toys, along with adoption center and kenel service. She has turned a small 
animal shelter into a thriving store and care center.</p>
